push_swap
====
## What is push_swap?
*This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.*

---

The ```Push_swap``` project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. 
You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

*Your goal ? Write 2 programs in C:*

  * The first, named ```checker``` which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read, checker executes them and displays OK if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO. 
  
  * The second one called ```push_swap``` which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest progam using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.

## Installation

You can try the project with the following commands:

First, clone the repository and it's dependencies to create the executable

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lgaultie/push_swap
cd push_swap
make
```
Then use the executables as presented below (checker may wait for manual instructions):
